# SwiftUI Apple HealthKit


## What you built? 

I followed a SwiftUI tutorial on how to implement the Apple HealthKit to extract user health data. The features included activity cards with different health stats as well as step charts for different time periods (e.g., last 6 months, last year)

Include some screenshots.

## What you learned

This was my first time programming in SwiftUI, so I got learn the language syntax as well as how to use the Xcode platform. I also learned how to integrate the Apple HealthKit to extract data from users' Apple Health.
